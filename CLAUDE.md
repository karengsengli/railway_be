### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Replace Mock Endpoints**: Update `route_segments_simple.py` with real database queries
2. **Test Database Schema**: Verify `line_station_orders` and related tables exist
3. **Add Station Reordering**: Implement move up/down functionality with database persistence
4. **Add Validation**: Input validation and error handling for all route operations

### Key Files to Focus On
- `src/route_segments_simple.py` - Current minimal implementation needing database integration
- `src/route_segments/models.py` - Database models for route management
- `admin-panel/src/components/StationOrderingManager.tsx` - Frontend station ordering component
- `admin-panel/src/components/RouteManagementSystem.tsx` - Main route management interface

### Database Tables Needed
- `line_station_orders` - Station ordering within lines
- `route_connections` - Direct connections between stations
- `interchange_points` - Transfer points between lines
- `interchange_transfers` - Transfer routes at interchange points

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Can add stations to a line
- [ ] Can reorder stations (move up/down)
- [ ] Can view route management data
- [ ] Admin panel loads without errors
- [ ] API endpoints return proper JSON responses
